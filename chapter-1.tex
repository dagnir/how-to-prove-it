\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item If we let $P$ stand for the statement ``We'll have a reading assignment'' and $Q$ stand for ``We'll have homework problems'' then we can represent the statement as $(P \lor Q) \land \lnot (P \land Q)$.
  \item If we let $P$ stand for the statement ``You will go skiing'' and $Q$ stand for ``There will be snow'', then we can represent the statement as $\lnot P \lor (P \land \lnot Q)$.
    \item $\lnot [(\sqrt{7} < 2) \lor (\sqrt{7} = 2)]$
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $P$ stand for the statement ``John is telling the truth'' and $Q$ stand for the statement ``Bill is telling the truth'', then we can represent the statement as $(P \land Q) \lor (\lnot P \land \lnot Q)$.
  \item Let the letters $P$, $Q$, and $R$ stand for the statements ``I will have chicken'', ``I will have fish'' and ``I will have mashed potatoes'' respectively, then the statment can be represented as $(P \lor Q) \land \lnot (Q \land R)$.
  \item Let the $P$, $Q$, and $R$ stand for the statements ``$3$ divides $6$'', ``$3$ divides $9$'', and ``$3$ divides $15$'' respectively, then the statement can be represented as $P \land Q \land R$.
  \end{enumerate}
\item For the following, we let $P$ stand for ``Alice is in the room'' and $Q$ stand for ``Bob is in the room''.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\lnot P \lor \lnot Q$
  \item $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$
  \item $\lnot P \lor \lnot Q$
    \item $\lnot P \land \lnot Q$
  \end{enumerate}
\item Only (a) and (c) are well-formed.  (b) and (c) both contain statements that are not connected by a logical symbol.
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item I will not both buy the pants and not buy the shirt.
  \item I will not buy the pants or shirt.
  \item Either I will not buy the pants, or not buy the shirt.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}

  \item Either Steve is happy or George is happy and not Steve, or George is not happy.
